            <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif"><b>I'm</b> currently a Second-year Software Engineering Student studying at Western University. As a former International Baccalaureate graduate and competitive soccer player, I have gained strong leadership skills that allow me to work well within any sort of team. </br>

            </br></br> <b>These</b> skills were evident at my previous job at Cargo Airport Systems. At this job, I had to work alongside the warehouse team to ensure the transfer of goods was processed correctly and adhered to the law. Through this, I directly worked with customers to ensure all paperwork was completed with quality, and that shipment of goods was done so with the utmost quality. 
                
            </br></br><b>As</b> a person, I enjoy listening to the dilemmas that other people face and trying to assist in solving them as well. My volunteer experience for the non-profit organization Fund Homecare, and the Law Organization Mississauga Community Legal Services show this compassion, as both organizations aim to help the less fortunate for no personal gain. 
                
            </br></br><b>At Fund Homecare</b>, I was part of the promotional committee, overseeing the creation of events held by the organization as well as setting up the software to run such events.
                
            </br></br><b>I</b> strive to keep learning in any aspect possible and would love to chat about these aspirations with anyone who is interested. As a dedicated and curious individual, I love undergoing new challenges and seeing them all the way through. </p>
